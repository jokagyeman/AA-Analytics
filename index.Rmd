##About Me
I am a second year PhD student in the department of Statistitics at the [University of Britisch Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/). My current research is on the modelling of disease transmission as well as building of transimission trees to help determine potential outbreaks under the supervision of [Prof. Matias Salibian-Barrera](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/matias-salibian-barrera).

My philosophy in life is to be the best at what I do and also ensure that I contribute to the success of others. To achieve this goal, I make sure to put myself in the best position to be a contributor to my community.
